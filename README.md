# RNG-Project
 Portfolio Project 1 for Codecademy
Description: For those days where you want to play a game, but just not sure what to play. The code will provide a mixture of three things. 1) The game itself, 2) what does the game offer? 3) what's the genre of the game?
Feature: The code will pull one of each to give you an idea of what sort of game to play or at least give you a bit of a chuckle. :)
This code a switch case to pull the results.
Technologies: Visual Studio Code
